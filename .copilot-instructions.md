# HIIT Timer Flutter Project - Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview

This is a Flutter application for a HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) timer, built using the Gadfly Flutter Template. The project follows strict architectural patterns and naming conventions to ensure maintainability, testability, and scalability.

## Architecture

### High-Level Separation of Concerns

The project uses a strict **inside/outside** layer separation:

- **Outside Layer**: Everything outside the widget tree (instantiated in `appRunner`)
  - Client Providers (singletons)
  - Effect Providers (singletons) 
  - Repositories (singletons)
- **Inside Layer**: Everything inside the widget tree (instantiated in widget tree)
  - Blocs (application state)
  - Cubits (entity state)
  - Effects (side-effects)
  - Widgets

### Key Principle
Everything from the "outside" layer must be passed into the "inside" layer through the **"front door"** - the `appBuilder` function. This enables comprehensive testing by allowing mocking of outside dependencies.

## Directory Structure

```
app/lib/
├── app/
│   ├── builder.dart        # "Front door" to widget tree
│   ├── runner.dart         # App initialization and dependency setup
│   └── configurations/     # App configuration files
├── inside/                 # Widget tree layer
│   ├── blocs/             # Application state (Blocs)
│   ├── i18n/              # Internationalization
│   ├── routes/            # Navigation and route-specific widgets
│   └── util/              # Inside utilities

│   ├── effect_providers/  # Effect factory providers (singletons)
│   ├── repositories/      # Business logic (singletons)
│   └── theme/            # Theme configuration
└── shared/               # Shared utilities and mixins
```

## Naming Conventions

### Client Providers
```dart
ClientProviderName_ClientProvider
// Examples:
Sentry_ClientProvider
Supabase_ClientProvider
```

### Effect Providers & Effects
```dart
EffectProviderName_EffectProvider
EffectName_Effect
// Examples:
Mixpanel_EffectProvider
Now_EffectProvider
Mixpanel_Effect
Now_Effect
```

### Repositories
```dart
RepositoryName_Repository
// Examples:
Auth_Repository
User_Repository
```

### Blocs (3 files: bloc.dart, events.dart, state.dart)
```dart
// Bloc
BlocName_Bloc
// Examples: Auth_Bloc, ResetPassword_Bloc

// Events
BlocName_Event_ActionName
// Examples: Auth_Event_SignOut, SignIn_Event_SignIn

// State & Status
BlocName_State
BlocName_Status
// Examples: Auth_State, Auth_Status
```

### Widgets (3-part naming)
```dart
WidgetLocation_WidgetType_WidgetDescription
// Examples:
Routes_Listener_AuthStatusChange      // Top-level widget
OnboardingFlow_Text_Title             // Flow-level widget
SignIn_Input_Email                    // Route-level widget
```

Widget locations:
- Route-specific: `inside/routes/flow_name/route_name/widgets/`
- Flow-specific: `inside/routes/flow_name/widgets/`
- Top-level: `inside/routes/widgets/`

## State Management Patterns

### Blocs vs Cubits
- **Blocs**: Application state, event-driven, cannot be called directly from widgets
- **Cubits**: Entity state, method-driven, can be called directly from widgets

### Concurrency
Default to `sequential()` transformer for easier reasoning. Use `concurrent()`, `droppable()`, or `restartable()` only when needed for performance.

### Dependencies
- **Blocs**: Can receive Effect Providers, Repositories, and Cubits
- **Cubits**: Can receive Effect Providers and Repositories
- **Repositories**: Can receive Client Providers and Effect Providers
- **Effect Providers**: Can receive Client Providers

## Key Dependencies & Patterns

### State Management
- `flutter_bloc` with `bloc_concurrency`
- Event-driven architecture preferred over method calls

### Navigation
- `auto_route` with Navigator 2.0
- Code generation for routes

### Testing
- `flow_test` for user flow testing
- `mocktail` for mocking (prefer explicit mocking over auto-mocking)
- Test Gallery at localhost:8001 for visual test results

### Backend & Services
- `supabase_flutter` for backend
- `sentry_flutter` for error reporting
- `mixpanel_flutter` for analytics

### UI & Internationalization
- `shadcn_flutter` for component library
- `slang_flutter` for i18n (YAML-based, not ARB files)

### Code Generation
- `build_runner` for general code generation
- `auto_route_generator` for navigation
- `json_serializable` for JSON serialization
- `slang` for internationalization

## Development Workflow

### Starting Development
1. `git pull origin main`
2. Run task: `[App] Prebuild (Once)`
3. Run task: `[Supabase] Stop` then `[Supabase] Start`
4. Run task: `[Supabase] Migration Up`
5. Run development tasks (Build Runner Watch, Slang Watch, etc.)
6. Debug with `development (debug)` configuration

### Testing Workflow
1. Run task: `[App] Test Gallery (Serve)`
2. Open localhost:8001 for Test Gallery
3. Write flow tests in `app/test/flows/`
4. Use CodeLens "FlowTest" to run individual tests
5. Use "Run and Debug" > "run flow tests" for all tests

### Code Generation
- Build Runner: `[App] Build Runner (Watch)` for auto_route and json_serializable
- Slang: `[App] Slang (Watch)` for internationalization
- Run `[App] Prebuild (Once)` after pulling changes

## File Organization Patterns

### Bloc Structure
```
blocs/
└── auth/
    ├── bloc.dart      # Auth_Bloc class
    ├── events.dart    # Auth_Event_* classes
    └── state.dart     # Auth_State and Auth_Status classes
```

### Repository Structure
```
repositories/
└── auth/
    └── repository.dart  # Auth_Repository class
```

### Effect Provider Structure
```
effect_providers/
└── mixpanel/
    ├── effect_provider.dart           # Mixpanel_EffectProvider
    ├── effect.dart                    # Mixpanel_Effect
    ├── effect_fake.dart              # Effect_Mixpanel_Fake (for testing)
    └── effect_provider_configuration.dart
```

## Testing Principles

### What to Mock
- Effect Providers (should be mocked in Flow Tests)
- Repositories (should be mocked in Flow Tests)

### What NOT to Mock
- Cubits (should NOT be mocked in Flow Tests)
- Repositories (should NOT be mocked in Flow Tests when testing internal behavior)

### Test Organization
- Flow tests focus on user journeys
- Unit tests for individual components
- Visual regression testing through Test Gallery

## Configuration Management

### Environment-Specific Config
- Development vs Production configurations
- Supabase credentials, Sentry DSN, SMTP settings
- Deep link configurations for Android/iOS

### Security Notes
- Replace all `CHANGE_ME` placeholders in configuration files
- Update deep link schemes before production
- Configure proper redirect URLs for different environments

## Code Quality Standards

### Linting
- Uses `very_good_analysis` lint rules
- Configuration in `app/analysis_options.yaml`
- Run `[App] Dart Fix (Apply)` for automated fixes

### Logging
- Use `logging` package for structured logging
- Configure log levels per environment
- Integration with Sentry for error reporting

## VS Code Integration

### Key Tasks
- `[App] Prebuild (Once)`: Initial setup after clone/pull
- `[App] Build Runner (Watch)`: Continuous code generation
- `[App] Slang (Watch)`: Continuous i18n generation
- `[App] Test Gallery (Serve)`: Visual test results
- `[Supabase] Start/Stop`: Local backend management

### Debug Configurations
- `development (debug)`: Local development
- `production (debug)`: Production testing
- `run flow tests`: Execute all flow tests

## Common Patterns to Follow

1. **Dependency Injection**: All dependencies flow from `appRunner` → `appBuilder` → widgets
2. **Error Handling**: Use structured logging with Sentry integration
3. **State Updates**: Prefer events over direct method calls for Blocs
4. **Side Effects**: Isolate in Effects and Repositories, not in Blocs/Cubits
5. **Testing**: Write flow tests for user journeys, unit tests for logic
6. **Internationalization**: Use YAML files with slang_flutter
7. **Navigation**: Use auto_route with code generation
8. **Styling**: Use shadcn_flutter components with custom theming

## Performance Considerations

- Use appropriate bloc concurrency transformers
- Lazy load Effect instances (not singletons)
- Optimize build runner watch tasks for development
- Use background tasks for long-running processes

This architecture ensures maintainable, testable, and scalable Flutter applications with clear separation of concerns and consistent patterns throughout the codebase.
